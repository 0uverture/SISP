\section{Overall structure}
This section aims to describe the overall structure of the AI and thus also this report.
The AI builds on the minimax algorithm for traversing the game tree.
As the game tree for a standard 7x6 board is too large to compute within a reasonable time period, we use a heuristic function for a board state.
Because the AI is required to find a solution in a fixed amount of time, we also use iterative deepening to optimize the time used each ply.
Further optimizing steps include alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables.
