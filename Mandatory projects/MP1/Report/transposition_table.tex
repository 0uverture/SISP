In a single run of minimax, it would be a wasteful to evaluate a state that has previously been evaluated.
To improve this, a hashmap of all calculated board states and their evaluation value is maintained throughout the run.
When using an evaluation from the table, it is important that it is based on equal or larger depth than the current depth -- otherwise the evaluation value would be less qualified.
Therefore the transposition table is cleared each time the depth changes during iterative deepening.

As the board in connect four is symmetrical, a simple optimization is to consider the mirror of a board state as having equal value to the actual board state.
This is easy to implement in the transposition table by considering mirrored positions in the hash function.
For example, when the hash function is processing the position $(0, 0)$, the function also considers the mirrored position $(7,0)$.
